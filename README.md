# Groopy

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Lockdowns and market closures got you down? Food delivery fees too expensive for you? Well, look no further! 
Our hack aims to bring daily necessities and other items to people by encouraging people to buy these items together.
Our website serves as a conduit that connects people living in the same area and looking for the same items to get it together so that delivery costs can be reduced, if not negligible.

The Carousell for groupbuy, if you will.

To begin, users can simply navigate to the category of items that they are looking for that is in their area and join the telegram group to buy the items with others.
Alternatively, users can initiate and act as the group leader by submitting and listing with a link to the telegram group for others to join, and discuss details on how they are going to purchase the items.
This allows users to meet others in their area who share similar interests with them (e.g. love for baking), forming new friendships and relationships in the process.

We understand that not all gurus have a platform for them to share their wisdom easily.
Our website offers these gurus an opportunity to share the best items and lobangs with others so that others can learn as well.
This way, knowledge can be passed down for others to benefit.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
